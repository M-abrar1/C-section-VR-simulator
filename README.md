# C-Section VR Simulation 

This project is an interactive 3D Cesarean section (C-section) simulation developed in Unity. Users experience the procedure from either the surgeon’s  perspective within a fully modeled operating room.

The simulation guides users through the key anatomical layers and procedural steps of a C-section, from abdominal incision to delivery of the baby and placenta. It includes interactive surgical tools, educational narration, sound effects, and an AI chat feature for clinical questions.

This project is designed for educational purposes to enhance understanding of surgical anatomy and obstetric procedures in an immersive environment.
